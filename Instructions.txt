What is a raster plot?
A raster plot is a type of graph used mainly in neuroscience 
to visualize the timing of spikes (or events) from one or multiple 
neurons over time. Each row in a raster plot typically represents 
a different neuron or trial, and each dot or tick mark represents 
an event or spike occurring at a specific time. This type of plot 
helps researchers understand the temporal patterns and synchrony of 
neural activity.
